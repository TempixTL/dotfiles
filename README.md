# tom's dotfiles

installation:

1.  place this git repository in the `$HOME` directory (`~`)
2.  once in the `dotfiles` directory, run `stow package` where `package` is the name of the program whose dotfiles you'd like to install
3.  have fun :)

note: my .zshrc assumes the location of the oh-my-zsh directory to be in `~/.config/oh-my-zsh`.
